Conducive Environment: Luck is excluded when considering a conducive context where results do not depend on random factors.

Repeated Experiences: By practicing repeatedly, you can identify visual patterns that facilitate the resolution of dilemmas, turning each repetition into a stepping stone toward mastery.

Feedback: It's not just about trying, but also about carefully analyzing each step of the process. Deep reflection is essential to extract valuable lessons from each experience.

Deliberate Practice: Constant exposure to new challenges and perseverance in overcoming them become the key to continuous development. Deliberate practice drives constant evolution toward excellence.
