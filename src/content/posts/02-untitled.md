In the immutable flow of time, each choice is an ephemeral petal that falls off the tree of our decisions.

We navigate the current of the irrevocable, where actions are intertwined with destiny woven by the cosmic loom.

Everything visible stands as an immutable testimony of decisions, sculpted by the relentless chisel of consequences.
